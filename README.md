This application was designed and coded by Adam Caplan, as part of a project for General Assembly.

The app is designed to provide an easy and fun way to learn sun salutations, record your practice, and track your progress.

## Instructions
Click the "sign up" tab at the top of the opening screen and fill out the form to create a new login. You will be logged in automatically upon successful sign up. If you already have a login, click the "sign in" tab, and fill out the form to begin.

You can change your password by clicking on the "Change password" link and filling out the form.

"Show Records" will take you to your practice journal. You can add a new session by clicking on the plus button at the bottom left corner of the screen. Click on "edit" and fill out the form to change an entry or click "delete" to remove an entry.

"Rounds tracker" takes you to a counting tool. Each time you complete a round of sun salutations, click on the sun icon, and the counter will increase. When you finish practicing, click "save", and the program will log your progress. Go back to "Show records" and edit the entry (listed under the current date) to add notes - or more rounds if you continue the practice later.

"Practice" will show you what a round of sun salutations looks like!

Enjoy!!
